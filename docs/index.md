**InSight** is a **smart and intuitive management tool** designed for **freelance photographers**, **videographers**, and **small creative teams**. It centralizes **clients**, **bookings**, and **service packages** in one place — streamlining day-to-day operations by simplifying **client tracking**, **appointment scheduling**, and **service organization**. The result: a more **efficient**, **organized**, and **creative-friendly workflow**.
