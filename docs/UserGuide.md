## 📚 Introduction

InSight is a lightweight Client & Booking manager designed for small **photography/videography** teams that sell
creative services directly to clients and businesses.

track of which package a client actually chose.

InSight consolidates your **people, bookings, packages, notes, and tags** into one clean workspace.


> **Who this is for:** Solo creators, small studios, and boutique teams in the **photography/videography market**
> looking for speed, clarity, and control—without paying with time or sanity.

### 3. Tag Keywords
Short, user-defined labels you attach to Clients and Bookings to surface specific details at a glance. 
The app does not enforce meaning — they are up to the user to define as they see fit.
#### Good practices

Keep tags short and consistent (prefer lowercase; use hyphens for multi-word tags).

Use tags for quick flags;

### 4. Date & Time Format

All bookings use the datetime format:  
`dt/dd/mm/yyyy HHmm`

**Example:**  
`dt/14/10/2025 1200` → October 14, 2025, at 12:00 PM.

### 5. Indexing

The INDEX parameter refers to the numeric position of an entry (client or booking) in the currently displayed list.

**Example:**  
`edit 1` edits the first client.  
`editbooking 2` edits the second booking shown in the list.
